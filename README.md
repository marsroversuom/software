# software

In this repository we will share the software written for the rover, as well as some documentation on it. The branch raspi will contain code for the raspberry pi while the branch arduino will contain code for the arduino. The controller branch will contain the interface for remote controlling the rover.

## The hardware used:
* Raspberry Pi 4B with raspi OS 64bit installed
* Arduino UNO


# To get started
1. Wire it all up, the diagram should be in the electrical
2. Upload Arduino code from the Arduino branch into the Arduino
3. Go to raspi branch and follow the instruction
4. Run the server and everything: currently named k_server.py
5. Go to controller branch and open index.html
6. Debug if something goes wrong
